# From Whole Exome Sequencing to Diagnosis: A Bioinformatic Approach for Autosomal Single-Gene Disorders


## Background
This project was developed as part of the Genomics course within the Master's degree in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics 
at Unimi. The course provided an introduction into Unix fundamental and human genomics, focusing on the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. It covered the process from FASTQ file analysis and variant calling to variant identification and coverage analysis. 


## Project Overview
This project focused on the identification of autosomal single-gene disorders in a cohort of 10 patient-family trios. Each trio, comprising a patient and their parents, was randomly generated and provided to students. The aim was to apply bioinformatics tools for variant discovery and analysis. The project was based on chromosome 16 only. For detailed insights, refer to the [Genomics Report]() included in this repository.
